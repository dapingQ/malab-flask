                        QIP is a new way to process information based on quantum physics. It harnesses the intriguing traits of quantum physics, including superposition, entanglement and etc., to enhance the communication security and computation power in an unprecedented way.
                        QIP research includes areas like quantum communication, computation and metrology. Our research focus includes the following areas:

                    <p>
                        In principle, quantum physics guarantees absolute secure communication due to the uncertainty principle, which has been employed in quantum cryptography. On top of that, novel communication protocols have been made possible in the quantum realm, such
                        as quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping and so on.

                    <p>The behavior of relatively small quantum systems cannot be calculated because quantum states contain much more information than their classical counterparts. However, if another quantum system is used to simulate the quantum system
                        of interest, then answers about the properties of the complex quantum system can be obtained. We use multipartite entangled photons to carry out quantum simulation and computation tasks.

                    <p>Photonic quantum information science provides a promising path for employing complex quantum photonic systems for both delivering quantum-enhanced technologies and exploring fundamental physics. While there have been impressive proof-of-principle
                        demonstrations based upon on bulk optical elements, future technologies will require integrated optics architecture for improved performance, miniaturization and scalability. The use of a single quantum photonic chip containing
                        all stages of optical qubit creation, manipulation, and detection will surpass bulk quantum optics.

                        In recent years, with the rapid development of experimental techniques for fast and sensitive measurements of light, it has become possible to carry out many of the thought experiments whose interpretations were widely debated in the course of the development
                        of quantum physics. In our group, we are interested in non-local aspects of multipartite entangled states, and delayed-choice experiments.
